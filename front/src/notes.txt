Image Optimization
Images in downloads are already optimized

Always use SVG when you can
- Responsive
- Don't have to worry about pixelating out
- scalable vector graphic
- small files
- customizable

If you can't use SVG, then use JPG/PNG

Good optimization vs. bad optimization
Google Page Speed Insights for testing your pages
